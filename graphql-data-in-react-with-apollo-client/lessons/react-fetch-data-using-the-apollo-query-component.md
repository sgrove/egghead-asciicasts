This is from relay!  The query component allows us to fetch data and provides the data as a render prop. We `import { ApolloProvider, Query } from "react-apollo";` and use it in our JSX tree. The `query` component has one mandatory prop, a query. For the query, we are again going to use the `gql` tag with a `query` string inside it. So far, so good.

#### app.js
```js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import ApolloClient from "apollo-boost";
import gql from "graphql-tag";
import { ApolloProvider, Query } from "react-apollo";

const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: "http://localhost:4000/"
});

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <ApolloProvider client={client}>
        <Query
          query={gql`
            {
              recipes {
                id
                title
              }
            }
          `}
          >   
      </ApolloProvider>
    );
  }
}
  
export default App
```

The query component's child must be precisely one function. It receives a query result object containing the `data`. This `data` object initially is empty, but once loading finished, it contains the results of our query. Without the `recipes` attached to `data`, we `return null`. Once we receive the recipes, we can render them.

```js
{({data }) => {
  if (data.recipes === undefined) return null;

  return (
    <ul>
      {data.recipes.map(({ id, title }) => 
        <li key={id}>{title}</li>
      )}
    </ul>
  )
}}
```

Works like a charm.

There's one gotcha, however. At the moment, we don't know why our `recipes` are undefined, because they could be still loading or an error could have occurred. To help with that, the query component exposes two more properties, `loading` and `error`. It allows us to run a different UI depending on the state of the query.

```js
{({data, loading, error }) => {
  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  if (error) return <p>Something went wrong</p>;

  return (
    <ul>
      {data.recipes.map(({ id, title }) => 
        <li key={id}>{title}</li>
      )}
    </ul>
  )
}}
```

If we refresh the web app, we can see our loading UI rendering until loading is finished and the actual data arrived.

To test the error UI, we stop the server. As expected, we now see the error case is rendered.

Before I wrap up this lesson about the query component, we want to refactor the code a bit. First, we're going to extract the query component, fetching and rendering the recipes into its own recipes component. Of course, we also need the required imports. 

#### recipes.js
```js
import React from "react";
import gql from "graphql-tag";
import { Query } from "react-apollo";

export default function() {
  return (
    <Query
      query={gql`
        {
          recipes {
            id
            title
          }
        }
      `}
    >   
      {({data, loading, error }) => {
        if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
        if (error) return <p>Something went wrong</p>;

        return (
          <ul>
            {data.recipes.map(({id, title}) => 
              <li key={id}>{title}</li>
            )}
          </ul>
        )
      }}
    </Query>
  )
};
```

Then, we can use the recipes component inside our application. 

#### app.js
```js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import ApolloClient from "apollo-boost";
import gql from "graphql-tag";
import Recipes from "./recipes.js"

const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: "http://localhost:4000/"
});

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <ApolloProvider client={client}>
        <Recipes /> 
      </ApolloProvider>
    );
  }
}
  
export default App
```

As you can see, our `recipes` still render, and our refactoring worked.

Next up, we extract the `query` into its own constant. While this entirely depends on your preferences, I find the code easier to pass if the query is separate. 

#### recipes.js
```js
import React from "react";
import gql from "graphql-tag";
import { Query } from "react-apollo";

const recipesQuery = gql`
{
  recipes {
    id
    title
  }
}
`;

export default function() {
  return (
    <Query
      query={recipesQuery}
    >   
      {({data, loading, error }) => {
        if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
        if (error) return <p>Something went wrong</p>;

        return (
          <ul>
            {data.recipes.map(({id, title}) => 
              <li key={id}>{title}</li>
            )}
          </ul>
        )
      }}
    </Query>
  )
};
```

Also, you can extract the `query` into a separate file inside or possibly even outside the component folder if you reuse it multiple times.
